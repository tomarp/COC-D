## Summary of living lab Data


- **S01_1:**
  - Lambda Value: 0.0
  - Mean Temperature (C): 26.05°C
  - Mean Illumination (lx): 188.10 lx
  - Proportion of Time Window Open: 100%
  - Proportion of Time Door Open: 44.78%
  - Interpretation: The subject experienced a comfortable temperature and moderate illumination upon arrival. However, there's a suggestion for more natural ventilation and light.

- **S01_2:**
  - Lambda Value: 0.0
  - Mean Temperature (C): 28.99°C
  - Mean Illumination (lx): 374.61 lx
  - Proportion of Time Window Open: 100%
  - Proportion of Time Door Open: 11.63%
  - Interpretation: Similar to S01_1, with higher temperature and illumination, still suggesting improvement in natural ventilation and light.

- **S01_3:**
  - Lambda Value: 0.0
  - Mean Temperature (C): NaN
  - Mean Illumination (lx): NaN
  - Proportion of Time Window Open: NaN
  - Proportion of Time Door Open: NaN
  - Interpretation: Incomplete data provided.

- **S01_4:**
  - Lambda Value: 0.5

  - Mean Illumination (lx): 184.31 lx
  - Proportion of Time Window Open: 100%
  - Proportion of Time Door Open: 0%
  - Interpretation: Suggesting a need for more ventilation despite comfortable temperature.

- **S01_5:**
  - Lambda Value: 0.0
  - Mean Temperature (C): 28.71°C
  - Mean Illumination (lx): 478.29 lx
  - Proportion of Time Window Open: 100%
  - Proportion of Time Door Open: 0%
  - Interpretation: Similar to S01_2, with higher temperature and illumination, still suggesting improvement in natural ventilation and light.

- **S01_6:**
  - Lambda Value: 0.0
  - Mean Temperature (C): 26.35°C
  - Mean Illumination (lx): 354.55 lx
  - Proportion of Time Window Open: 100%
  - Proportion of Time Door Open: 35.82%
  - Interpretation: Consistent need for more natural ventilation and light.

- **S01_8 to S01_21:**
  - Lambda Value: 0.5
  - Incomplete data provided.

### Overall Interpretation:
- Across most observations, there's a consistent need for more natural ventilation and light to improve comfort after commuting.
- Some entries lack complete data, particularly lambda value, temperature, and illumination.
